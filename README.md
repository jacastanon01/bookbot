# Bookbot

Bookbot is a simple Python-based command-line tool that reads text from a .txt file, analyzes the text, and generates a report. It provides a breakdown of word count and frequency of each letter.

## GOALS

My goal for this project was to write my first python script using an object-oriented approach to organizing the code. In this directory, I have two main files. One in the subfolder labeled `FP/` and the other in `OOP/`. It isn't really necessary for a project this small, but as my understanding grows, I hope this approach will guide me in future software considerations.

### PREREQUISITES

Python (version 3.12 or later)

### INSTALLATION

Clone this repository using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jacastanon01/bookbot.git
```

### USAGE

This tool requires a path to a .txt file you wish to analyze. Use the following format to execute the script. There are two main scripts that are functionally the same. Specify which script you'd like to run and the subdirectory. For example, to run the OOP file:

```sh
python OOP/main.py <path_to_your_file/file_name.txt>
```

If no exceptions are raised, the output should provide a detailed report:
